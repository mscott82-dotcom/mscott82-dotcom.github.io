        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        </header>
        <main>
        <h2>Client</h2>
        <p>For this project, a client outside the class was contacted.</p>
        <p>This web based application will focus on promoting the client's community made film projects and any upcoming works they have.</p>
        <p>The client expressed a need for a comprehensive method of reaching new people to take part in their projects. This website will feature an interest page form to make this process easier.</p>
        <h2>Client Contact Information</h2>
        <p>At this current time, the client wishes to keep their contact information private.</p>
        <p>Client Name: [Private]</p>
        <p>Client Email: [Private]</p>
        <p>Client Phone: [Private]</p>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>5 Different pages are planned for this project.</p>

        <figcaption>Wireframe Map for the Project</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>index.html will serve as the main landing page for the site, and features basic introductory information.</p>
        <p>Leaping off from the homepage will be an interactive client overview page that links to 3 gallery pages</p>
        <p>The client's work will be displayed across these pages, and will include relevant information for each displayed work.</p>
        <p>about.html will be accessible from any page at the footer and will include the necessary personal details about the client such as email, name, etc.</p>
        <h2>Interactivity</h2>
        <p>Javascript will be used especially in the about.html page to construct an interactive form that users can submit, with the intention of communicating interest or feedback on the Client's related work.</p>
        <p>Each gallery page will feature interactive elements that add a different flair for each project being presented. The plan for each interactive object is to be decided with the Client.</p>
        <h2>Page Design</h2>
        <p>A consistent visual language will be maintained throughout all pages, ensuring the creative choices in the website do not cause interference with the Client's displayed content.</p>
        <p>The majority of this project will focus on an aesthetic display of images. Page content must not visually interfere with the gallery images. CSS styles will be applied to organize the images into readable, consistent layouts.</p>
