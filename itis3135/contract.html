                <h2>Contract</h2>
                <p class="contract">I, MATTHEW SCOTT agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2025, FALL, ITIS3135-101 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
                    
                    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 
                    
                    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
                    
                    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
                    
                    I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. 
                    
                    <i>Signed: Matthew Scott , 04/09/2025</i></p>
